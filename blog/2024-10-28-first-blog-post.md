This is my first blog post in this site.

<!-- truncate -->

It's been ages since I want to create my own web page and blog to share whatever I want to share. Finally it's manifested 😮‍💨.

I will use this site as my portfolio pages, documentation of what I've learnt, and share something that is interesting. I hope that this pages will help my future self when I forgot about something that I've learnt before and I hope this will help other people too.

Please take all of my writings here with the grain of salt. Use and adjust it with your own needs and wants.

Happy reading! ✨
